                <li>
                    We retain the right to seize the equine without notice where these terms and conditions have been
                    breached or we believe it is in the best interests of the equine to do so.

                <li>
                    If the rehomer wants to change the location where the equine is kept, they shall give us at least 
                    two weeks notice unless there are significant extenuating circumstances. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The rehomer is not permitted to take the equine out of the UK without written permission.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The rehomer is responsible for all costs relating to the equine during the duration of the loan,
                    including the cost of returning it to us if required. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The rehomer shall indemnify Leigh Rescue Centre and its servants against 
                    any claim for injury or damage caused by the equine while on loan to them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In agreeing to rehome the equine, the rehomer has taken into consideration and problems the equine may 
                    have as listed on the listing and contract
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the equine is returned to or seized by Leigh Rescue Centre, all paperwork related to it will be returned 
                    by the rehomer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the equine is returned to or seized by Leigh Rescue Centre, the rehomer will no longer have any contact with it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Except in an emergency, at least two weeks notice should be given if the rehomer wishes to return the equine.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    The equine is not rehomed with any tack or equipment, unless specifically agreed otherwise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While we request that the equine be only used for the agreed for purpose, we do not warranty its fitness 
                    for that purpose in anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The rehomer will provide the equine with suitable veterinary care whenever it is in ill-health or injured 
                    and will follow the vet's advice. The rehomer bears sole responsibility for resulting fees.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The rehomer must follow an appropriate worming programme, ensure that the equine's feet are regularly trimmed and/or 
                    shod by a qualified farrier, and keep the equine's vaccinations for ‘flu and tetanus up to date.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The equine remains our property throughout the loan.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a vet recommends euthanasia, or in an emergency, the equine shall be humanely destroyed either by a 
                    veterinary surgeon or a licensed knacker. The rehomer must notify Leigh Rescue Centre as soon as possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The equine must not be used for breeding.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The equine must not sold, given away or used commercially without written permission from Leigh Rescue centre.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the equine is a colt too young for castration, the rehomer agrees to have him castrated as soon as 
                    possible.
