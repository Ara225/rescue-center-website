            </p><p>
        We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we strive to use commercially acceptable means
        of protecting it. This includes following security best practices, using industry standard cloud services, logging access 
        to your data etc. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100%
        secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p><p>
        In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will
        take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may
        have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.

        Log files are normally automatically deleted within 30 days, unless they are required for security purposes. Queries are
        also automatically deleted within 30 days, unless there is a compelling legal reason. We try to delete unsuccessful
        rehoming and volunteering applications within 30 days. Successful applicants will usually have their data kept for as
        long as they have one of our horses or are volunteering with us.
            </p><p>
        <div><span class="w3-xlarge w3-hide-small w3-border-teal w3-bottombar">Children's Privacy</span></div>

        Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information
        from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we
        immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided
        us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to remove it.

        changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective
        immediately, after they are posted on this page.
