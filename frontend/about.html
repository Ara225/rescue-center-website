              Leigh Rescue Centre is a not for profit, family run charity, rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming horses/ponies 
              in and with the community. We normally work with the NHS, and local authorities as well as people/families and 
              businesses in the community. Rescues, like people have different personalities and can have physical, emotional, 
              and behavioral issues. People often see themselves in a horse, and when they turn that horse around, they find 
              the horse turns them around.
            </h5>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">
              The charity was founded in 2016 and is based in Greater Manchester and Cheshire. We are not currently a registered 
              charity with professional fund raisers, high administration and paid staff. We do it out of love for people and 
              ponies mostly out of our own money. Present yearly donations come nowhere near the charity registration fee, though 
              that may be an option in the feature. Any money donated is noted and goes 100% on the rescues unless requested 
              otherwise.

            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
              We rescue, care for and rehome ponies and horses. We additionally try to make a difference to the people and places 
              around us - be it visiting a care home with a pony; helping the homeless, or providing families with food, clothes 
              bikes, and books, making shoe boxes, collecting clothes for Romania etc A little love goes a long way....
            </h5>
      
            <p class="w3-text-grey">
              We usually have about 10 - 20 ponies/horses at any time- 
              each with their own unique story. Neglected, orphaned, abused, sick, injured,and/or abandoned. 
              All our horses are rescues. Some have been signed over from the police or R.S.P.C.A, some are cast offs from dealers, and some
              have been brought in by loving owners no longer able to look after them. With the help of the community we do our
              best to look after them and lovingly turn them around. The horses are regularly seen by the vet, farrier, and equine
              dentist.

            <h1>How We Do It</h1>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
              We initially set the project up with a large settlement and we still are mostly family funded. Donations only make
              up a fraction of our weekly expenses, but it all helps and a careful note is made. The horses we have come from 
              those offered to us by owners, police etc. We do most of the work ourselves and rent farms or land to keep the horses 
              on.
            </h5>
      
            <p class="w3-text-grey">
              Volunteers are welcome (though we currently can't recruit any due to COVID); we always need help with a wide range of 
              things from building shelters to taming horses. We also have a selection of horses available for rehoming. Donations 
              towards vet, farrier, horse dentist, fencing, shelters, and rent, are a great help, but please, please don't feel you 
              have to. We're here to serve the community, not to be served.

            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
              We aim to help some of the many neglected and unwanted horses and ponies in existence around the UK while 
              benefiting the community as best we can through opportunities for people to get involved and community outreaches.
            </h5>
      
            <p class="w3-text-grey">
              We believe that turning a needy pony 
              or place around can help turn people around too - it's a two way process. 
              In particular, we have found that people with autism often form an amazing bond with
              rescues, and as a result A considerable proportion of the ponies that have come through the rescue centre 
              have been lovingly re-homed with families affected by autism.
